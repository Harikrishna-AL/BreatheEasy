# 🌬️ BreathEasy
Breathe better air

## Description
Our project aims to develop an easy-to-use Android application which can be used to detect the air quality in a locality. In order to do so, the user needs to provide his locality, types of plant in the region and the number of people living in that area. Based on this information, we help the user determine whether his immediate environment has good quality air, and if that is not the case, the user is provided a marketplace from where he/her can purchase new plants, which further provides new customers to the local vendors.
